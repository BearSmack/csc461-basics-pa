Sorry professor. I used log git instead the performace. So I can't show each update Changelist number. 

11/17/2015
1. changed double type to float (data structures, OpenGL)
2. added a switch in main.cpp
3. moved some duplicated code out of while loop in main()
4. reindented to make it more readable

11/18/2015
1. used SqrtOpt() instead of original sqrtf() in Vect4D.h (2.7x faster in release mode)

11/20/2015
1. moved variable declearations out of the loop in ParticleEmitter::draw()
2. added SIMD in Vect4D
3. made particle all public (easy to debug)
4. wrote a new ParticleEmitter::Execute() instead of the old ugly one

11/22/2015
1. combined Vect4D norm() and Cross() into updatePos()
2. combined SqrtOpt() into updatePos() instead of sqrtf()
3. replaced pointer with const reference

11/23/2015
1. removed std::list() in the ParticleEmitter
	much faster!
2. replaced =Vect4D() by setter
3. added operator/=() in Vect4D
4. updated Matrix setter and getter
5. updated Inverse() in Matrix
6. used SIMD _mm_xor_ps() to swap two Vect4Ds 
	0.3ms faster!
7. move CreateLinkedList() from main into ParticleEmitter constructor
8. just copied curr -> prev
	0.1ms faster!

11/24/2015
1. removed Pivot in draw(), it useless
2. removed tmp = scaleMatrix * scaleMatrix * transCamera * transParticle * rotParticle;
   added TotalTransform(tmp, p->scale, cameraMatrix.v3, p->position, p->rotation);
   2ms faster!
3. clear useless parts
4. compiler optimazied
	0.5ms faster
